This is the report for Problem Set 6 in the course \emph{TMA4280 Introduction To Supercomputing} at NTNU, march/april 2014. It was written by Einar Baumann, Dzenan Dumpor and Teodor Heggelund.

We do realize that the report is longer than the recommended maximum of 12 pages, but it contains many big figures and tables.

The Git repository containing the code for the project is found at \url{https://github.com/einar90/tma4280_gruppe/tree/master/ex6/code/parallell_poisson/poisson}. Additionally, the source code for the main parallellized diagonalization functon is shown in appendix \ref{sec:DiagonalizationPoisson2Dfst}.
