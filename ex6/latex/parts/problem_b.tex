\section{Verification of correctness} % (fold)
\label{sub:verification_of_correctness}
To be able to guarantee that our solver ran as expected we had to do a check that the error decreased at an expected rate. If we halved the steplength $h$ we would expect that our error would be reduced by a factor of 4. ($\mathcal{O}(h^2)$)

As we can see from the plot in Figure~\ref{fig:error} there are no convergence issues with our solver. The small ``dip'' at the end is possibly caused by round-off errors.
