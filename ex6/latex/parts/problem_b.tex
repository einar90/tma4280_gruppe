\subsection{Verification of correctness} % (fold)
\label{sub:verification_of_correctness}
To be able to guarantee that our solver ran as expected we had to do a check that the error decreased at an expected rate. If we halved the steplength $h$ we would expect that our error would be reduced by a factor of 4.

As we can see from the plot there are no convergence issues with our solver.
